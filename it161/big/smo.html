      <h2 class="subheader">Social Media Optimization (SMO)</h2>
          <p>How can you reach people and how can people learn about your brand and website without marketing and advertising? Sure, you can use SEO (search engine optimization) to create an online presence by making your website attractive and searchable by using appropriate keywords, metatags, headings and links. But that only makes your website appear on search engines like Google, Bing and Yahoo, etc. And people nowadays don’t use the internet solely to search random stuff on Google. They are usually on the internet for the social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat and Youtube, etc. People do watch tv and newspapers, but if you ask most people what they can’t live without, they will probably say the internet, and especially social media! That’s why in order to grow your clientele, boost your online presence and connect to your audience, you need Social Media Optimization, SMO for short.</p> 

          <p>According to Will Kenton from Investopedia, companies using multiple social media platforms may use Internet-based tools designed to improve the organization and delivery of their content. These tools allow an employee tasked with creating social media content to schedule content across multiple platforms at the same time, as well as respond to any engagements on the posts including comments or messages from the audience.Sharing tools on social media platforms allow users to share content on the Internet almost instantaneously. Because of this, many companies try to create content that users will pass along to their friends and connections. This strategy, called viral marketing, attempts to achieve a broader reach by getting engaged users of social media platforms to share content rather than relying on users to find the content on their own.(Investopedia) In other words, you need tools to manage your brand's social media and constantly engage with your audience by sharing and replying to comments.</p>

          <p>One of these tools include SMO plugins. Edublogs says, SMO plugin is designed to optimize your content for social networks by improving the way your content is displayed when shared on a social media website.  This helps achieve more re-shares, re-tweets, likes, and increased visits to your site. It improves Social Media Optimization (SMO) by adding Twitter Cards and Open Graph meta tags to posts and pages of your website.  These are how you control how the posts and pages are displayed on social media when you or someone else shares links to your site.(Edublogs) With an OG and Twitter card you make your post more eye-catching and shareable!</p>

          <p>One thing you need to keep in mind is to keep up with ever evolving internet and social media. There are many social media tactics that companies utilize! But, some of those tactics eventually cease to be effective and become outdated over time. That’s why you need to use relevant tactics. For example, on SproutSocial there are a bunch of tactics that are applicable to this day. Those are:</p>
